\subsubsection{Contravariant Tracer}\label{code:Tracer}\index{Tracer}
The notion of a |Tracer| is an action that can be used to observe
information of interest during evaluation. |Tracer|s can capture (and
annotate) such observations with additional information from their
execution context.

\begin{code}
newtype Tracer m s = Tracer { tracing :: Op (m ()) s }
\end{code}

\index{Tracer!instance of Contravariant}
A |Tracer| is an instance of |Contravariant|, which permits new
|Tracer|s to be constructed that feed into the existing Tracer by use
of |contramap|.

\begin{code}
instance Contravariant (Tracer m) where
    contramap f = Tracer . contramap f . tracing

\end{code}

Although a |Tracer| is invoked in a monadic context (which may be
|Identity|), the construction of a new |Tracer| is a pure function.

This brings with it the constraint that the derived |Tracer|s form a
hierachy which has its root at the top level tracer.

\subsubsection{|nullTracer|}\label{code:nullTracer}\index{nullTracer}
The simplest tracer - one that suppresses all output.

\begin{code}
nullTracer :: (Applicative m) => Tracer m a
nullTracer = Tracer $ Op $ \_ -> pure ()

\end{code}

\subsubsection{tracingWith}\label{code:tracingWith}\index{tracingWith}
Accepts a |Tracer| and some payload |s|. First it gets the contravariant
from the |Tracer| as type "|Op (m ()) s|" and, after "|getOp :: b -> a|" which
translates to "|s -> m ()|".

\begin{code}
tracingWith :: Tracer m a -> a -> m ()
tracingWith = getOp . tracing

\end{code}
