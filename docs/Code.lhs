\begin{abstract}
This framework combines logging, benchmarking and monitoring.
Complex evaluations of STM or monadic actions can be observed from outside
while reading operating system counters before and after, and calculating
their differences, thus relating resource usage to such actions.

Through interactive configuration, the runtime behaviour of logging or the
measurement of resource usage can be altered.

Further reduction in logging can be achieved by redirecting log messages to
an aggregation function which will output the running statistics with less
frequency than the original message.

\section{Main concepts}

The main concepts of the framework:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item LogObject - captures the observable information
  \item Trace - transforms and delivers the observables
  \item Backend - receives and outputs observables
  \item Configuration - defines behaviour of traces, routing of observables
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{LogObject}

|LogObject| represents an observation to be logged or otherwise further processed.
It is annotated with a logger name, meta information
(timestamp and severity level), and some particular message:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering{
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[ draw
     , fill=blue!14
     , text depth=1.8cm
     , minimum width=4.8cm
     , minimum height=3.6cm
     ] (logObj)
     {LogObject};
\node[ text width=4cm
     ] (logObj)
     {LogObject};
\node[ draw
     , text width=4.1cm
     , fill=yellow!15
     ] (who)
     {Who sent the message};
\node[ draw
     , text width=4.1cm
     , fill=orange!15
     , below=0cm of who
     ] (meta)
     {Info about the message};
\node[ draw
     , text width=4.1cm
     , fill=green!15
     , below=0cm of meta
     ] {The message itself};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

Please see |Cardano.BM.Data.LogItem| for more details.

\subsection{Trace}

You can think of |Trace| as a pipeline for messages. It is a \textit{consumer} of
messages from a user's point of view, but a \textit{source} of messages from the framework's
point of view.
A user traces an observable to a |Trace|, which ends in the framework that further
processes the message.

\tikzstyle{block} = [ rectangle
                    , draw
                    , text centered
                    , minimum height = 2em
                    ]
\tikzstyle{brown}  = [fill = brown!20]
\tikzstyle{red}    = [fill = red!15]
\tikzstyle{green}  = [fill = green!15]
\tikzstyle{blue}   = [fill = blue!14]
\tikzstyle{line}   = [draw, -latex']
\tikzstyle{dline}  = [draw, line width = 0.4mm, dotted]

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Place nodes
\node [block, red]                                        (user)     {User};
\node [block, blue,  below = 1cm of user]                 (m1)       {$m_2$};
\node [block, green, below = 0.5cm of m1]                 (trace)    {Trace};
\node [              left  = 3.5cm of trace]              (lb)       { };
\node [              below right = 0.1cm and 0.1cm of lb] (label)    {Framework};
\node [              right = 3.5cm of trace]              (rb)       { };
\node [block, blue,  below = 0.5cm of trace]              (m2)       {$m_1$};
\node [block, brown, below = 1cm of m2]                   (handler)  {Some handler};
% Draw edges
\path [line]  (user)  -- (m1);
\path [line]  (m1)    -- (trace);
\path [dline] (trace) -- (lb);
\path [dline] (trace) -- (rb);
\path [line]  (trace) -- (m2);
\path [line]  (m2)    -- (handler);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Please see the section \ref{contravariantfunctors} for more details about
the ideas behind |Trace|.

\subsection{Backend}

A |Backend| must implement functions to process incoming messages of type |LogObject|.
It is an instance of |IsEffectuator|. Moreover, a backend is also life-cycle managed.
The class |IsBackend| ensures that every backend implements the |realize| and |unrealize|
functions.

The central backend in the framework is the |Switchboard|. It sets up all the other backends and
redirects incoming messages to these backends according to configuration:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\tikzstyle{block} = [ rectangle
                    , draw
                    , text centered
                    , minimum height = 2em
                    ]
\tikzstyle{brown}  = [fill = brown!20]
\tikzstyle{blue}   = [fill = blue!14]
\tikzstyle{line}   = [draw, -latex']

\centering{
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Place nodes
\node                                                       (nextM)  {\ldots};
\node [block, blue,  below = 0.5cm of nextM]                (m5)     {$m_5$};
\node [block, blue,  below = 0.5cm of m5]                   (m4)     {$m_4$};
\node [block, brown, below = 1cm of m4]                     (switch) {Switchboard};
\node [block, blue,  below left = 1cm and 1cm of switch]    (m1)     {$m_1$};
\node [block, blue,  below = 1cm of switch]                 (m2)     {$m_3$};
\node [block, blue,  below right = 1cm and 1cm of switch]   (m3)     {$m_2$};
\node [block, brown, below = 1cm of m1]                     (be1)    {$Backend_A$};
\node [block, brown, below = 1cm of m2]                     (be2)    {$Backend_B$};
\node [              right of = be2, node distance = 1.3cm] (etc)    {\ldots};
\node [block, brown, below = 1cm of m3]                     (beN)    {$Backend_N$};
% Draw edges
\path [line] (nextM)  -- (m5);
\path [line] (m5)     -- (m4);
\path [line] (m4)     -- (switch);
\path [line] (switch) -- (m1);
\path [line] (switch) -- (m2);
\path [line] (switch) -- (m3);
\path [line] (m1)     -- (be1);
\path [line] (m2)     -- (be2);
\path [line] (m3)     -- (beN);
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Configuration}

|Configuration| defines how the message flow in the framework is routed and the behaviour of distinct |Trace|s.
It can be parsed from a file in YAML format, or it can explicitly be defined in code.

Please note that |Configuration| can be changed at runtime using the interactive
editor (see |Cardano.BM.Configuration.Editor| for more details).

\section{Overview}

Figure \ref{fig:overview} displays the relationships among modules
in |Cardano.BM|.

\subsection{Backends}

As was mentioned above, the central backend is the |Switchboard|
that redirects incoming log messages to selected backends according to
|Configuration|.

The backend |EKGView| displays runtime counters and user-defined values in a browser.

The |Log| backend makes use of the \href{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip}{katip}
package to output log items to files or the console. The format can be chosen to be textual or JSON representation.

The |Aggregation| backend computes simple statistics over incoming
log items (e.g. last, min, max, mean) (see |Cardano.BM.Data.Aggregated|).
Alternatively, |Aggregation| can also estimate the average of the values passed in
using \emph{EWMA}, the exponentially weighted moving average.
This works for numerical values, that is if the content of a |LogObject| is a |LogValue|.

The backend |LogBuffer| keeps the latest message per context name
and shows these collected messages in the GUI (|Editor|), or outputs them to the switchboard.

Output selection determines which log items of a named context are routed to
which backend. In the case of the |Log| output, this includes a configured
output sink, \emph{scribe} in \emph{katip} parlance.

Items that are aggregated lead to the creation
of an output of their current statistics. To prevent a potential infinite loop
these aggregated statistics cannot be routed again back into |Aggregation|.

\subsection{Trace}

Log items are created in the application's context and passed in via a hierarchy
of |Trace|s. Such a hierarchy of named traces can be built with the function
|appendName|. The newly added child |Trace| will add its name to the logging context and
behave as configured. Among the different kinds of |Trace|s implemented are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item |NoTrace| which suppresses all log items,
  \item |SetSeverity| which sets a specific severity to all log items,
  \item |FilterTrace| which filters the log items passing through it,
  \item |ObservableTrace| which allows capturing of operating system counters.
\end{enumerate}

(further behaviour types are implemented in |Cardano.BM.Data.SubTrace|)
\subsection{Monitoring}

With |Monitoring| we aim to shortcut the logging-analysis cycle and immediately
evaluate monitors on logged values when they become available. In case a monitor
is triggered a number of actions can be run: either internal actions that can
alter the |Configuration|, or actions that can lead to alerting in external
systems.

\subsection{IMPORTANT!}

It is not the intention that this framework should (as part of normal use)
record sufficient information so as to make the sequence of events reproducible,
i.e. it is not an audit or transaction log.

  \includegraphics[scale=0.48]{OverviewModules.pdf}

\caption{Overview of module relationships. The arrows indicate import of a module. The arrows with
a triangle at one end would signify "inheritance" in object-oriented programming,
but we use it to show that one module replaces the other in the namespace,
thus specializes its interface.}\label{fig:overview}
