The bracket around an IO action will enter a named context, evaluate the action, and return its result. A bracket, in a named context, can be placed around a STM action:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
bracketObserveIO
    :: Configuration
    -> Trace IO a
    -> Severity
    -> Text
    -> IO t
    -> IO t
    \end{lstlisting}

The set of observed counters are traced as \texttt{ObserveOpen}, \texttt{ObserveClose} and \texttt{ObserveDiff} with the indicated severity to the Trace. An exception thrown in the action will be traced and rethrown.

Other bracketing functions exist: \texttt{bracketObserveM} and \texttt{bracketObserveX}.

    \section*{\href{https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-monitoring-framework/blob/master/iohk-monitoring/src/Cardano/BM/Observer/STM.lhs}{Benchmarking STM transaction}}

A bracket, in a named context, can be placed around an STM action:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
bracketObserveIO
    :: Configuration
    -> Trace IO a
    -> Severity
    -> Text
    -> STM t
    -> IO t
    \end{lstlisting}

This will return the result from successfully evaluating the STM action, which does not have access to logging.

A second bracket function also traces the log items (pairs of meta data and content) which are output by the STM action and returns its result.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
bracketObserveLogIO
    :: Configuration
    -> Trace IO a
    -> Severity
    -> Text
    -> STM (t,[(LOMeta, LOContent a)])
    -> IO t
    \end{lstlisting}

    \section*{\href{https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-monitoring-framework/blob/master/iohk-monitoring/src/Cardano/BM/Data/Aggregated.lhs}{Aggregation}}

Observables can be forwarded for aggregation, which currently can aggregate them into a basic statistics or an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA).

Aggregated values reenter the switchboard with '\#aggregation' prepended to their name, and can be routed like ordinary messages.

Values may be of type:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
data Measurable
    = Microseconds
    | Nanoseconds
    | Seconds
    | Bytes
    | Severity
    | PureI Integer
    | PureD Double
    \end{lstlisting}

The statistics computes: minimum, maximum, mean, std. dev., and count of (1) the observed values, (2) their differences to the previous, and (3) the time between messages.

    \section*{\href{https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-monitoring-framework/blob/master/iohk-monitoring/src/Cardano/BM/Data/Counter.lhs}{Observables --- OS counters}}

Platform independent:

\texttt{MonotonicClock }clock with μs precision\newline
\texttt{GhcRtsStats    }Haskell RTS values (gc, mem)

Linux specific:

\texttt{MemoryStats    }reports memory usage\newline
\texttt{ProcessStats   }lots of process info: cpu, mem, io, ...\newline
\texttt{IOStats        }block device I/O\newline
\texttt{NetStats       }network I/O

The Linux specific counters for the current process are obtained from the \texttt{/proc} interface into the kernel.

To trace observables, the configuration needs to find a definition of a subtrace ObservableTrace for the context name. Only the mentioned counters in the list will be recorded.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
CM.setSubTrace
    config
    "proc.observed"
    (Just $ ObservableTrace observablesSet)
  where
    observablesSet = [ MonotonicClock
                     , MemoryStats
                     ]
    \end{lstlisting}

%    A complete example of bracketing monadic and STM actions is in \texttt{example-complex}. Run it with:
%
%    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
%cabal new-run example-complex
%    \end{lstlisting}
%
%or
%
%    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
%stack run example-complex
%    \end{lstlisting}
