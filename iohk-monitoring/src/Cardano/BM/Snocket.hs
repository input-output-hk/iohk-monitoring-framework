-- | Named pipes and Berkeley sockets have different API when accepting
-- a connection.  For named pipes the file descriptor created by 'createNamedPipe' is
-- supposed to be used for the first connected client.  Named pipe accept loop
-- looks this way:
--
-- > acceptLoop k = do
-- >   h <- createNamedPipe name
-- >   connectNamedPipe h
-- >   -- h is now in connected state
-- >   forkIO (k h)
-- >   acceptLoop k
--
-- For Berkeley sockets equivalent loop starts by creating a socket
-- which accepts connections and accept returns a new socket in connected
-- state
--
-- > acceptLoop k = do
-- >     s <- socket ...
-- >     bind s address
-- >     listen s
-- >     loop s
-- >   where
-- >     loop s = do
-- >       (s' , _addr') <- accept s
-- >       -- s' is in connected state
-- >       forkIO (k s')
-- >       loop s
--
-- To make common API for both we use a recursive type 'Accept', see
-- 'berkeleyAccept' below.  Creation of a socket / named pipe is part of
-- 'Snocket', but this means we need to have different recursion step for named
-- pipe & sockets.  For sockets its recursion step will always return 'accept'
-- syscall; for named pipes the first callback will reuse the file descriptor
-- created by 'open' and only subsequent calls will create a new file
-- descriptor by `createNamedPipe`, see 'namedPipeSnocket'.
