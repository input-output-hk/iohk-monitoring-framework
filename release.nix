  #   namespace                      optional cross compilation prefix                 build machine

  #                 component type                          cabal pkg and component*
  #
  # * note that for `libs`, $component is empty, as cabal only
  #   provides a single library for packages right now.
  # * note that for `exes`, $component is also empty, because it
  #   it provides all exes under a single result directory.
  #   To  specify a single executable component to build, use
  #   `cexes` as component type.

  # Example:
  #
  #   nix-tools.libs.iohk-monitoring.x86_64-darwin -- will build the iohk-monitoring library on and for macOS
  #   nix-tools.libs.x86_64-pc-mingw32-iohk-monitoring.x86_64-linux -- will build the iohk-monitoring library on linux for windows.
  #   nix-tools.tests.iohk-monitoring.tests.x86_64-linux -- will build and run the tests from the
  #                                                          iohk-monitoring package on linux.
